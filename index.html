    <p>In nature, <span class="good">Good</span> & Evil do not exist. The Universe itself is neither <span
            class="good">good</span> nor <span class="bad">bad</span>, but a potential in permanent development.</p>

    <p>In life, there are 4 types of people.</p>
    <ul class="flex-container">
        <li class="flex-item_1">- people who think the Internet is <span class="good">good</span>,</li>
        <li class="flex-item_2">- people who think the Internet is evil,</li>
        <li class="flex-item_3">- people who think the Internet is cats,</li>
        <li class="flex-item_4">- people who don't think about it.</li>
    </ul>

        <p class="gras">Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that rock’s perspective on Mars
            or that gaz
            opinion from Jupiter, nothing cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and there’s no
            such
            thing as an issue.</p>
        <p>Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing exists if the brain doesn’t think it.
            Nothing
            exists neither if our senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense, our reality
            changes.
            That’s possible because our perception is limited : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis
            translate the message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality changes depending on that
            way.
            Therefore, if we can change reality that much, everything’s fake.</p>
        <p>They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that person as divine. Pull yourself out of
            that
            grip and the divine falls from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But the person
            is
            the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works like that : it’s not just that you can make your
            world,
            it’s that you passively do it anyway.

            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors
            came around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I
            don't know.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses
            with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of
            events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it
            <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.”
            <br>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
            his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,” and the farmer
            responded, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't know.” The
            next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his
            son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!”
            Again, he said, “Is it <span class="good">good</span>? Is it <span class="bad">bad</span>? I don't
            know.”

            <blockquote class="citation"> whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and
                it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or

    <p>Conclusion : <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas
        are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas.
        Let's not make a big deal out of it...
